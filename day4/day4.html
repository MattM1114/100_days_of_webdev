<!-- file paths are  an unique location in  a folder in your pc-->
<h1>File Paths</h1>
<p>File paths allow us to locate files and folders in our file system. 
They specify the location (or path) to a file.</p>
<p> most file paths are now able to be found graphically on a computer
    by clicking through folders and files. However, 
    it is still useful to understand and they are quicker
    to type out file paths manually when needed.
    They can direct someone to a file or a folder. 
the root is usually your hard drive like your c drive .
there are 2 types absolute and relative .</p>
</br>

<p> Absolute file paths are when you kne the exact 
    folder and drive where your file is well a relative file path is a form of
    searching when you are that will show where it could be, they are usually shorter and are always
    valid unless deleted. There are certain special symbols like .. at the begging which means go up a 
    level the ./ will stay in the current main folder you can omit it now in most places 
    but this always works  more often when you don't not omit</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

<h2>web pages</h2>
<p>For a web site they we would normally store it in a folder with all the assets in
    the File formate with .html  at the end.There is an exercise in file 4.1+Webpages that shows us this </p>
    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    <p>For a website to be accessible online it needs to be hosted. Hosting refers to storing 
        files, code, and other content on a server that is connected to 
        the internet. Some common hosting options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Github Pages - Free static website hosting through Github repositories</li>
            <li>Netlify - Free static website hosting with continuous deployment from Git repos</li>
            <li>Heroku - Free hosting for simple dynamic web apps, scales with paid tiers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When hosting a website, the files will be placed on the server and accessed via a
    domain name or IP address. For example, a site hosted on Github Pages may have a URL 
    like myusername.github.io. The server handles requests for 
    pages and assets and serves them to users visiting the site.</p>
