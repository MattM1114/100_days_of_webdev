<h1>File Paths</h1>
<p>File paths allow us to locate files and folders in our file system. 
They specify the location (or path) to a file.</p>
<p> most file paths are now able to be found graphically on a computer
    by clicking through folders and files. However, 
    it is still useful to understand and they are quicker
    to type out file paths manually when needed.
    They can direct someone to a file or a folder. 
the root is usually your hard drive like your c drive .
there are 2 types absolute and relative .</p>
</br>

<p> Absolute file paths are when you kne the exact 
    folder and drive where your file is well a relative file path is a form of
    searching when you are that will show where it could be, they are usually shorter and are always
    valid unless deleted. There are certain special symbols like .. at the begging which means go up a 
    level the ./ will stay in the current main folder you can omit it now in most places 
    but this always works  more often when you don't not omit</p>
